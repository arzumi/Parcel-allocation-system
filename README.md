# Parcel-allocation-system-
• This is a parcel allocation system that can efficiently allocate a list of parcels to given trucks with specified priorities. 
• Collaborated with a partner to create a system which can allocate parcels based on their priorities and trucks’
priorities that are determined by the user.
• Single-handedly implemented the core algorithm of the system, greedy algorithm, which allows the program to
allocate more than 1500 parcels correctly based on parcels’ and trucks’ priorities.
